# restaurant-landing-page

Well, I'm very happy with the result of this project. If I go back and compare it to the first Odin project that I've made it is a great progress!
This restaurant page was made for me to practice Webpack and some code splitting. I also consumed the mealdb API so I wouldn't have to type manually every dish in the restaurant.
